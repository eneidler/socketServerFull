# Go Socket Server Project

## Socket Server
Simple Go socket server setup that can be used to build out more advanced server projects.

This current iteration is built out as a chat server with simple chat functionality, but it can be expanded to whatever you need the socket server for.

I included simple commands like '/list', '/kick <nickname>', etc. for the chat.

## Socket Client 
Simple client project for testing the socket server.

This can be opened in multiple terminals to test the chat functionality via 'go run .' in each terminal while in the socketServerFull/socketClient directory.
